## Project Startup

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone 
```

Install Bootstrap

```bash
  npm install bootstrap@3
```

## Future Implementations

The ''about us'' sector of the website is not yet executed with Bootstrap, it is made with pure HTML and CSS, as well as the footer is not attractive, very simple and not in accordance with the rest of the page, and finally the carousel is small, I would like to adjust it to 100% viewport size just below the navigation menu
